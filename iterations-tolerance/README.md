# Explanation of what the hell is going on

Yea, I know, using numbers is not such a proper way to identify experiments. Thats why you are a physicist and I'm an engineer (I don't even know how to write physhicist lol). But trust me, I know what I'm doing.
Ok, so jokes aside: 
- Folder number one -> tol=1e-10
- Folder number two -> tol=1e-8
- Folder number three -> tol=1e-5
- Folder number four -> tol=1e-3
- Folder number five -> tol=1e-1
 
I keep asking myself if it is even necessary to go as high as 1e-1, but is just for the sake of having a super stupid and previsible result that we can say look! Im that smart that I can even predict that such tolerance gives less than one iteration!! How smart we are, aren't we? I know, I'm so ironic, perhaps the british influence.
